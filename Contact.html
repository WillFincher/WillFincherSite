  <h1> How to get in touch with me!</h1>
  
  <p> there are a number of ways to get in contact with me whether you are looking to work on a project together, want to know more about my professional work, or just want to discuss a topic in one of my blogs or something that you think I may find interesting. To get the quickest response, shoot me an email. I check my personal email every evening.s</p>

  <ul>
    <li> <a href="mailto:william.d.fincher@gmail.com" style="color: #0077cc;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Email</a> </li>
    <li> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/william-fincher-6888a0256/" style="color: #0077cc;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn</a> </li>
    <li> <a href="https://x.com/WallacianWonder" style="color: #0077cc;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter Account</a> </li>
  </ul>

  <p> These are the only platforms where I am likely to see a message in a reasonable time. They are in order of what I am most likely to check. I read a lot on substacks, however, I have no intention currently to post.</p>
