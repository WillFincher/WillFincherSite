# Welcome to My New Blog

This is my first post written in **Markdown**! It's much easier to write than editing a JSON file.

## Why Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Created by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown is now one of the world’s most popular markup languages.

### Features

- **Bold** and *Italic* text
- Lists (like this one!)
- [Links](https://www.markdownguide.org)
- Code blocks:

```javascript
console.log("Hello, World!");
```

Stay tuned for more updates!
