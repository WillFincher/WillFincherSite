      <h2>📚 Studying</h2>
      <p>I think active study is critical in continuing to grow as a person and a thinker. There are various topics that
        I am enthralled by, and as I am interseted in discussing / researching them, I will post them below. Always feel
        free to contact me if you want to discuss any of these topics!

      <ul>
        <li> Law </li>
        <li> Philosophy </li>
        <li> History</li>
      </ul>
      </p>

      <h2>💻 Professional Life</h2>
      <p>

        I am currently the Operations & Compliance Coordinator at Global Village Project, an accredited Special Purpose
        Educational Instution that serves refugee girls with interupted or limited education.
        <br>
        <br>
        I am deeply committed to the mission of Global Village Project, and I highly encourage you to check out our
        work.<a href="https://globalvillageproject.org/">Here</a> is the link.

      </p>

      <h2>🧠 Projects</h2>
      <p> The main project that I am working on right now is getting this website off the ground. I haven't done any
        programming since I was in High School, but this will be a good way to get back into it.
        <br>
        <br>
        Hopefully, I start to enjoy work of this nature. I have a few ideas percolating, namely, some sort of free
        pomodoro timer web extension, thing, or a youtube shorts blocker.
        <br>
        <br>
        A wider project I am interested in is technology use and addiction. Being such a critical part of our lives,
        education, and work, I want to find the optimal relationships with technology, as well as, discover ways to
        disincentivize the negative aspects.
