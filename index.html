    <h1>Things I am working on</h1>
    <p><em>Last updated: August 21, 2025</em></p>

    <h2>🧠 Projects</h2>
    <p> The main project that I am working on right now is getting this website off the ground. I haven't done any
      programming since I was in High School, but this will be a good way to get back into it.
      <br>
      <br>
      Hopefully, I start to enjoy work of this nature. I have a few ideas percolating, namely, some sort of free
      pomodoro timer web extension, thing, or a youtube shorts blocker.
      <br>
      <br>
      A wider project I am interested in is technology use and addiction. Being such a critical part of our lives,
      education, and work, I want to find the optimal relationships with technology, as well as, discover ways to
      disincentivize the negative aspects.

    <h2>📚 Studying</h2>
    <p>I think active study is critical in continuing to grow as a person and a thinker. There are various topics that
      I am enthralled by, and as I am interested in discussing / researching them, I will post them below. Always feel
      free to contact me if you want to discuss any of these topics!
