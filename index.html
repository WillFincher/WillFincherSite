    <h2>ðŸ“š Studying</h2>
    <p>I think active study is critical in continuing to grow as a person and a thinker. There are various topics that I am enthralled by, and as I am interseted in discussing / researching them, I will post them below. Always feel free to contact me if you want to discuss any of these topics!

    <ul>
      <li> Law </li>
      <li> Philosophy </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>ðŸ’» Professional Life</h2>
    <p>

  I am currently the Operations & HR Coordinator at Global Village Project, an accredited Special Purpose Educational Instution that serves refugee girls with interupted or limited education.
  <br>
  <br>
  I am deeply committed to the mission of Global Village Project, and I highly encourage you to check out our work.<a href="https://globalvillageproject.org/"> Here </a> is the link.

    <h2>ðŸ§  Projects</h2>
    <p> The main project that I am working on right now is getting this website off the ground. I haven't done any programming since I was in High School, but this will be a good way to get back into it. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Hopefully, I start to enjoy work of this nature. I have a few ideas percolating, namely, some sort of free pomodoro timer web extension, thing, or a youtube shorts blocker. 
    <br>
    <br>
    A wider project I am interested in is technology use and addiction. Being such a critical part of our lives, education, and work, I want to find the optimal relationships with technology, as well as, discover ways to disincentivize the negative aspects.
