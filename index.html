    <h2>üìö Studying</h2>
    <p>I am currently engaged in the study a few things! I hope to provide some updates into my progress in these domains. I will list them out here.

    <ul>
      <li> Law </li>
      <li> Computer Science, Mathematics, and AI. </li>
      <li> Philosophy </li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>üíª Professional Life</h2>
    <p>

  I am currently the Operations & HR Coordinator at Global Village Project, an accredited Special Purpose Educational Instution that serves refugee girls with interupted or limited education.
  <br>
  <br>
  I am deeply committed to the mission of Global Village Project, and I highly encourage you to check out our work.<a href="https://globalvillageproject.org/"> Here </a> is the link.

    <h2>üß† Projects</h2>
    <p> The main project that I am working on right now is getting this website off the ground. I haven't done any programming since I was in High School, but this will be a good way to get back into it. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Hopefully, I start to enjoy work of this nature. I have a few ideas percolating, namely, some sort of free pomodoro timer web extension, thingy.
    </p>
    <h2>üìù Learning Journal </h2>
    <p> the file thing I hope to host on the website is my own learning journal. I find learning recaps / journals to be great ways to make an isolated process collaborative. So, I intend to reflect on my study days at the end and write a quick recap to post here!s</p>
