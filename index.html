    <h2>ðŸ“š Studying</h2>
    <p>I am currently engaged in the study a few things! I hope to provide some updates into my progress in these domains. I will list them out here.

    <ul>
      <li> Law </li>
      <li> Computer Science, Mathematics, and AI. </li>
      <li> Philosophy </li>
    </p>

    <h2>ðŸ’» Professional Life</h2>
    <p>

  I am currently the Operations & HR Coordinator at Global Village Project, an accredited Special Purpose Educational Instution that serves refugee girls with interupted or limited education.
  <br>
  <br>
  I am deeply committed to the mission of Global Village Project, and I highly encourage you to check out our work.<a href="https://globalvillageproject.org/"> Here </a> is the link.

    </p>

    <h2>ðŸ§  Projects</h2>
    <p> The main project that I am working on right now is getting this project off the ground. I haven't done any programming since I was in High School, but I find that this will likely be a fun development project!
    <br>
    <br>
    If I start to enjoy projects like this, I may start to work on some other projects. If I do that, I will make a project's page that links to that. (My next idea is to create a simple pomodoro timer?)
