<br>  
I was born in 2000 in Atlanta, Georgia. I grew up in a suburb of Atlanta called Peachtree City, famous for its golf cart paths. (I even drove to school in a golf for a few years!) I attended K-12 in the Fayette county school system, then I went off to College at Georgia College & State University, with a declared History Major and Theatre minor. After four short days, and one brief meeting with the theatre department, I changed my minor to English.

Intially, I had intended to get my History degree and then start teaching high school history. Inspired by the many wonderful history teachers I had throughout my education, I wanted to be able to spread that joy to others. However, I quickly discoverd that I was not destined for teaching, as I found the actual research, writing, and argumentation surrounding history to be exhilirating. So, like many other students stepping foot into the the world of academia, I was ready to pursue a long career in the study of history.

I graduated from Georgia College in 2022 with a B.A. in History and minor in English. I had just completed my senior thesis
