  <h1>Will's Biography!</h1>
  <p><em>Last updated: May 19, 2025</em></p>
<p> Thanks for Checking out my website and my bio. There isn't anything particuarly interesting here yet, but you will be able to find a link to my most recent resume and CV below. Feel free to ask any questions via my contact page.
<br>
<br>  
I was born in 2000 in Atlanta, Georgia. I grew up in a suburb of Atlanta called Peachtree City, famous for its golf cart paths. (I even drove to school in a golf for a few years!) I attended K-12 in the Fayette county school system, then I went off to College at Georgia College & State University, with a declared History Major and Theatre minor. After four short days, and one brief meeting with the theatre department, I changed my minor to English. 
<br>
<br>
Intially, I had intended to get my History degree and then start teaching high school history. Inspired by the many wonderful history teachers I had throughout my education, I wanted to be able to spread that joy to others. However, I quickly discoverd that I was not destined for teaching, as I found the actual research, writing, and argumentation surrounding history to be exhilirating. So, like many other students stepping foot into the the world of academia, I was ready to pursue a long career in the study of history.
<br>
<br>  
I graduated from Georgia College in 2022 with a B.A. in History and minor in English. I had just completed my senior thesis and despite almost four years of planning to apply to graduate school, I didn't. There were a few reasons for this, one of them being that the job market for history PhD's is kinda abysmal. Another being, I can go back. I still can. But, I cannot get a PhD then not have done it, ya know?
<br>
<br>  
After graduating, I briefly worked for a for-profit organization. I felt that the work felt explicity evil (as a Naive 22 year old, I didn't know this industry had a prexisting reputation for scumminess.). In the end, I quit after that brief stint and started looking for jobs in the non-profit section. With the hope that they could provide mission based work that would make it easier to show up everyday. Luckily, I stumbled upon Global Village Project and that allowed me to contribute to an organiation that I believe in.

<h2> Why not Return to History?</h2>
<p> Evidently, I have not returned to the study of history after getting into the work force. And if you take a look at my home page, you can see that my current trajectory has me going to law school relatively soon. Why? There are a few reason's I will outline below, I think each of these reason's will eventually develop into a fully fledged blog post, but I also think these ideas are important driving forces for my life.

<h3>Career Outcomes</h3>
Believe it or not, the academic job market is not that great. Well ... it could be great, for those that are pursuing degrees in fields that produce highly demanded research. As much as I love history, its not that kind of field. It moves slow,
